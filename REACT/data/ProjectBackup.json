        "description": "<p>To promote the celebration of the Nike air max a customization site was devised for Air Max Day 2016. &nbsp;This mobile site created a customized poster featuring their own beloved Air Max shoe. Visitors were asked to take a photo while holding their sneaker then the site would asist in seperating the shoe from the backround of the image. Once the shoe was extracted from the photo, the user could customize their poster with &nbsp;different background images and appliced textures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the most interesting&nbsp;featuresof the site&nbsp;is the fact that all the image manipulation is handled in the browser. Since there is always a large concern for how user&#39;s content is handled, I mitigated the issue by keeping all data local to the users device.

With some help from the blending capabilities of HTML canvas I was able to render translated text first into the canvas then apply new textures as the visitor swiped the screen. By packing all the textures into a sprite I could then decouple the slogan text from the texture images which made the system much more flexible.

        "description": "<p><strong>While working with space150 I rebuilt a photo booth and kiosk applications. Most of the time a photobooth was requested from a client, it was expected to be delivered within a few hours. Preparations for a deployment usually meant reskinning the applications and implementing some new visual effect applied to each photo. <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Since the photo booth installations seemed to be a common occurrence I pushed for some additional time to rebuild the applications to be as robust as possible. In efforts to reduce unforeseen issues it was decided the system should be able to scale to extremely large events. The system was designed as a two pieces; a photobooth to actually take the picture and a kiosk for visitors to retrieve their images. This platform would allow for a high throughput of people by reducing the bottleneck at the camera. THis also allowed for multiple kiosks to be deployed if needed. The system is &nbsp;built on Microsoft surface devices using a Canon dslr camera and custom lighting trigger using a micro controller. &nbsp;Both the photo booth and kiosk applications were built in c++ and cinder and leveraged sdks to take full control over the camera. &nbsp;The design of the applications were built to be as modular as possible. Since each iteration called for a variation of the original functionality it was essential to keep the code flexible. <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The image processing and delivery mechanism is based on amazon&#39;s lambda functions and s3 buckets. <\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As the photobooth continues to be deployed it gains new functionality such as video capture and chroma keying. It also becomes more robust against environmental issues such network coverage and bandwidth. <\/strong><\/p>\r\n",

        "description": "<p>The University of Oregon recruitment center interactive mirror shows potential recruits a glimpse into their future playing football as a Duck. &nbsp;Since one of the big draws for the university is their leading edge technology and equipment. This 8ft tall installation features a led&nbsp;display which showcases all of the available gear in fine detail.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the campus tour reaches&nbsp;this installation, the student is first presented with a reflection of themselves. The guide then activates the space and reveals the content behind the glass using a custom iOS application. Once activated, various UofO themed&nbsp;particle effects animate across the display. When ready, the tour guide can trigger a custom tailored highlight reel where the prospective athlete&#39;s stats and highlights animate&nbsp;into view. &nbsp;Since, the main goal of the display is to demonstrate the&nbsp;cutting edge equipment and facility. The guide can display&nbsp;variety of football gear from a tap of a button on the remote application. The remote application takes a step further to allow the guide to control the rotation of each piece of equipment on display.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This installation is comprised of a content entry website, redundant display application and an iOS application acting as the remote control.The first prototype was to understand how the one way mirror would affect the content on display. In order to keep costs down, I found an affordable option to create a 1 way mirror by using a special film and acrylic panels. When placed in front of a bright display we quickly saw how the dark areas became very reflective and allowed the design team to compensate for the effect.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next challenge was to devise a system that would allow a mobile application to smoothly control playback of video with very high precision&nbsp;on a separate application machine. The solution I created had the mobile app broadcast small UDP&nbsp;packets over the local network. The application computer parsed the messages and updated the current video playback position. While fundamentally this worked, a lot of refinement was still required to ensure smooth and accurate playback. I had to dig into the video libraries and make modifications to the player in order to&nbsp;balance performance of the video. I also&nbsp;implemented redundant messaging&nbsp;&nbsp;scheme to guard against lost data over the network since I was using UDP protocol.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another hurdle was to ensure extremely high reliability of the entire system. This request led to creating a system architecture using duplicate display computers and controllable video hardware. I developed&nbsp;heartbeat system which allowed the secondary computer to monitor the primary machine. If the primary machine ever became unresponsive the secondary machine could switch the video inputs and would send out an email notifying about the switch.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n",

                "description": "<p>To promote the celebration of the Nike air max a customization site was devised for Air Max Day 2016. &nbsp;This mobile site created a customized poster featuring their own beloved Air Max shoe. Visitors were asked to take a photo while holding their sneaker then the site would asist in seperating the shoe from the backround of the image. Once the shoe was extracted from the photo, the user could customize their poster with &nbsp;different background images and appliced textures.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the most interesting&nbsp;featuresof the site&nbsp;is the fact that all the image manipulation is handled in the browser. Since there is always a large concern for how user&#39;s content is handled, I mitigated the issue by keeping all data local to the users device. For every step of the process the&nbsp;poster in progress was&nbsp;saved to the browser&#39;s local storage. &nbsp;Once the poster was complet&nbsp;it was saved to the device&#39;s photo library where the user could then decide which social media outlet&nbsp;they wanted to post to.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy far the most challenging feature&nbsp;for this app was tracing functionality for seperating the shoe from the&nbsp;imported photo. By using multiple html5 canvases and a JavaScript library to help with path drawing I was able to create the functionality while maintaining the original images quality. Additionally, the process allowed for the ability to adjust the shape so that a user could dial in their cutout.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince this mobile web app was released worldwide we had to account for multiple languages. While traditional text could be handled with simple translations, it became more challenging to apply different textures to the slogan within the poster. With some help from the blending capabilities of HTML canvas I was able to render translated text first into the canvas then apply new textures as the visitor swiped the screen. By packing all the textures into a sprite I could then decouple the slogan text from the texture images which made the system much more flexible. This also led to improved loading times and responsiveness of the interactions which.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n",

                "description": "<p>The mobile app for the Thomas Jefferson Foundation guides visitors as they explore the grounds of Monticello. The app depicts the stories of those who lived and worked on the plantation through in depth videos, interviews and artifacts. &nbsp;The application features annotated maps and dynamic infographics. All the data in the application is powered by a CMS where new content can be added by the foundation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the challenges for the application was to create an experience that performed well both outdoors and indoors. Since the grounds featured several sites that were essential to the history of the estate, it was important to provide location specific content as the guest approached.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several technologies were examined such as standard GPS and accelerometer data to provide a user&rsquo;s location. However, most technologies were not able to deliver the accuracy needed or the needed hardware was not available on a large range of devices. This testing led to the decision to use beacons to create a proximity based navigation for the app.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The selection of type of beacon proved to be a challenge as well. Since a big focus was placed on maintainability of the system by the Foundation&rsquo;s technical team. The popular Estimote beacons were enclosed in a silicone casing which would have stood up to the elements however replacing batteries was not an option. Ultimately beacons made by a company called GELO were chosen. These beacons had a hard plastic exterior which made them suitable for outdoor use and easy maintenance.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>While integrating the beacons into the application we quickly found many of the common issues that for the bluetooth signal. Inconsistent triggering was one of the most challenging to deal with. The radio signal from the beacons can be affected by many types of environmental variables. Nearby materials like metal and wood could reflect and absorb the signal in unexpected ways water content could impeded the signal considerably. So since the human body contains a large percentage of water, &nbsp;people gathering around a beacon would restrict the detection range. Most of the issues could be remedied by strategic positioning and orientation of the beacons and increasing broadcast strength but considerable onsite testing was needed.<\/p>\r\n",

                "subtitle": "<p>The Saint John Paul II National Shrine in Washington, DC recently installed two multi-screen interactive installations; a 12 foot wide multi-touch wall, and a object recognition enabled table exploring Pope John Paul&#39;s papacy.<\/p>\r\n",
                "description": "<p>The Saint John Paul II National Shrine recently added&nbsp;two digital installations&nbsp;for their new exhibit featuring Pope John Paul II&#39;s humanitarian efforts. A&nbsp;large touch&nbsp;wall presents the numerous trips the Pope&nbsp;took during his papacy and a interactive&nbsp;table features&nbsp;the stories of World Youth Day participants.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were&nbsp;many challenges related to the the World Travels&nbsp;interactive wall. Since the display was comprised of six HD screens, it created a canvas&nbsp;with a 6480 x 1920 resolution. All screens had to function as one when&nbsp;the application was in the attraction state but also independently as users explored the content. Individual&nbsp;screens would act as a scrolling view to display each trip the Pope had taken. Within each of the trip views, imagery and video could be explored as well by swiping horizontally.&nbsp;&nbsp;The application was built on C++ and Cinder since we knew very large content could be rendered while&nbsp;maintaining smooth interaction for six simultaneous users. We were confident that we would also be able to easily incorporate proximity sensors into the&nbsp;C++ application to detect visitors as they passed by.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the application needed to handle&nbsp;touch&nbsp;events for numerous onscreen objects&nbsp;my partner&nbsp;Stacey and I revamped the touch handling system that I originally developed for <a href=\"http://www.prudolph.com/projects/59531f824e375c001f68cca6\">The Native American Voices<\/a> exhibit. The new system became much more flexible and allowed for new input technologies like the PQ Labs infrared touch frame. Some of the first tests were making sure we could control an individual&nbsp;object out of hundreds with a single touch point. While dragging colored boxes around on a large screen may not have seemed all that impressive, we knew we had a solid foundation to build the rest of the application on.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next steps were building out the scroll view interactions that would be the main structure of displaying content. It took a bit of thought of how&nbsp;the scroll views would determine when to move vertically or move a cell&#39;s content horizontally. After the user initially touched the screen we determined the direction of movement by comparing subsequent touch readings to the initial touch point. While normally we expect mobile devices give us this interaction for free, it is not a pre built feature in c++ applications like this one. Another&nbsp;challenge was that the design team was looking&nbsp;for a parallax effect as the user swiped horizontally between images. At first, I was not sure how to accomplish&nbsp;the desired effect but after a few prototypes and a deeper understanding of how frame buffer objects worked&nbsp;I was finally able to reproduce the effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sonar based depth sensors were placed at the bottom of each screen to report&nbsp;how close an a visitor was from the screen. The application was setup to take&nbsp;readings from each sensor 60 times a second and&nbsp;decide if the application should transition into the interactive mode. &nbsp;One interesting side effect of using sonar sensors in an array is that neighboring&nbsp;sensor&#39;s signal will disrupt the readings of other sensors which caused erratic readings.&nbsp;&nbsp;When encountering this issue for the first time it was tough to diagnose the problem, but after realizing all the sensors were emitting at the same time I was able to correct the problem by polling each sensor individually.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite feature of the wall is the effect triggered by the presence sensors as&nbsp;visitors approach. In the idle state, several high resolution images animate across all six screens. When a visitor steps in front of the screen the images blur into the background and a introductory view is displayed for each panel. As the guest move&nbsp;from screen to screen the introduction views change height in response to the movement. This reaction creates a playful interaction encouraging a deeper look into the content.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n",

                "description": "<p>The University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology opened their Native American Voices exhibit which features an extensive collection of artifacts accompanied by several digital installations. The space features&nbsp;four 15ft towers made up of three&nbsp;HD displays. Combined, these screens create a large vertical scrolling view where visitors can explore influential leader profiles, artifacts, and videos examining themes revolving Native American culture.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each tower is displays a large cinematic video that can be seen far across the museum welcoming vistors into the space. At the base of each tower a proximity sensor determines when a person approaches, trigging the tower to transition&nbsp;from a the full screen video&nbsp;to the interactive content, inviting guests to explore deeper. Visitors can navigate tiles by scrolling all the content veritcally, which present artifacts and influential persons through highly detailed imagery, video and info graphics. Users can also highlight genres of content resulting in subtle full screen animations.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>After seeing the designs for the attraction loop for the first time, another challenge quickly rose to the surface. The design called for playing a video across all three screens, and right away I started thinking of how I was going render video content across 3 vertical screens. My first attempt was based on a simple video&nbsp;player, but the playback was just too slow to be acceptable. After a few other prototypes, I ended up creating an image sequence of the video. My initial&nbsp;attempt at this solution would tried to load all frames into memory upfront. I&nbsp;quickly found the limitation of the hardware&#39;s memory capacity, so I&nbsp;modified the solution which leveraged multithreading for loading&nbsp;and unloading each frame as the video progressed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>After this project was completed,&nbsp;I had a deeper understanding of what goes&nbsp;on behind the scenes for a touch screen application. Since this was the first time building a C++ application with a more traditional touch&nbsp;interface I had built out&nbsp;system for handling touches for all of the tiles that were on display. As I planned out the touch handling system for this project I also took into account that it should also be designed for future projects. Eventually this platform became the starting point for the <a href=\"http://www.prudolph.com/projects/59531fed4e375c001f68cca7\">Pope John Paul II<\/a> and the <a href=\"http://www.prudolph.com/projects/595072ce04a40a001f7fb7f6\">National Air and Space Museum<\/a> installations.<\/p>\r\n",
