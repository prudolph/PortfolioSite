Since then, I have worked with several organizations to create&nbsp;numerous award winning mobile apps and digital installations&nbsp;that step out of the ordinary to engage people in the stories of art, culture and history.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>I constantly research new technology in efforts to create&nbsp;more seamless experiences. &nbsp;Additionally, I am always&nbsp;looking for new techniques to build better systems that handle heavy use and continue to perform flawlessly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBelow you will find some of the&nbsp;applications and installations that I am most proud of.&nbsp;These projects range from large interactive walls to mobile and web apps.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/paulportfoliostorage/Resume_PaulRudolph_2017.pdf\">â–¼&nbsp;RESUME&nbsp;<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\r\n",
