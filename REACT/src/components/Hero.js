          My name is Paul Rudolph, I am a software engineer focused on building digital experiences that captivate and tell meaningful stories. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from Temple University 2012. Since then, I have worked with several organizations to create numerous award winning mobile apps and digital installations that step out of the ordinary to engage people in the stories of art, culture and history. I constantly research new technology in efforts to create more seamless experiences.  Additionally, I am always looking for new techniques to build better systems that handle heavy use and continue to perform flawlessly.
